WalkInThePark
=============

Scorecard, mainly for Disc Golf but can of course also be used for any golfers. It does include optional integration with the Pebble smartwatch.

It is made with PySide for the Nokia N9 phone but the plan is to separate the GUI part even more so that it can easily be ported to other Linux phones, like Tizen and Sailfish based ones.

There are hard coded stuff here still but it can be used anyway, I guess. All hard coding will go away while features is added, like creating and choosing course and players. Even adding what type of golf you play will be added. "Basket 2" when playing club-golf might be annoying to some.. 

Adding a config file also has to be done, defaults are nice to keep there.
Editing the config? I like vim as I never use a phone without terminal access but if someone wants to add a GUI, feel free.

The Pebble integration "library" was, ehh, lifted from https://github.com/makrco/smarthomewatch which does not have any license at all (as this one also, for now. I'll be GPL if I can choose that.)
